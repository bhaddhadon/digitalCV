            <h1>Driver Onboarding Auto-Approval</h1>


            <strong> Problem Statement</strong>
            <p>Driver Onboarding process's turnaround time is a bit long, especially in a big market with huge population. The bottleneck is a manual reviewing process not being scalable and, more often than not, resulting in the application being disapproved due to some flaws in the uploaded documents.</p>
            
            <strong> Solution</strong>
            <p>An automated process mimicking checks performed by humans. The process combines the use of </p>

                <li>1. OCR of info on documents/images and make sure the info is matched/ mostly matched with the info submitted from the registration portal. </li>
                <li>2. Object Detections of items in both positive and negative lists to make sure the image meets the requirements. </li>
                <li>3. Image Quality measures: blurriness/ overexposure/ underexposure</li>
                <li>4. Identity Matching: between submitted images and ID documents</li>
                <li>5. Document Spoof Detection: PDF metadata/ Image splicing/ Copy-move-forgery</li>
            </ul>

                    <li>Custom Object Detection: 95% mAP</li>
                    <li>Generic Object Detection: 90%+ Recall</li>    
                </ul>

                <li>Turnaround time reduction</li>    
            </ul>
